# 💻 Love Babbar DSA Sheet Progress Tracker

##📌 Current DSA Plan

I’m using Love Babbar’s DSA course as a foundation (first 25 lectures).  
After that, I’ll move to Striver’s DSA Sheet for structured problem-solving practice.  
This way I cover both theory + hands-on problem solving systematically.  
I'm solving these to build a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms using **C++**.

## 📌 About Me

 Hi! I'm **Manthan Khotele** (aka **MAKX Dev**), a IT undergrad at GHRIIT, Nagpur.  
My goal is to crack **off-campus SDE roles** by building strong DSA, system design, and project skills.  
This repo is a part of my journey.
